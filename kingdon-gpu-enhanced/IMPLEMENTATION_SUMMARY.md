### 2. Multi-Core CPU Parallelism

- **Process Pool Execution**: Used Python's `concurrent.futures.ProcessPoolExecutor` for parallel ray processing.

- **Dynamic Worker Count**: Automatically adapts to the available CPU cores.

- **Chunk-Based Processing**: Divides workload into optimal chunks for parallel processing.

### 3. Memory Optimization

- **Streaming Processing**: Processes rays in batches to minimize memory usage.

- **Efficient Data Structures**: Uses NumPy arrays for efficient data transfer between CPU and GPU.

- **Scaling Analysis**: Measures how performance scales with wavelength count.

- **Theoretical Performance Estimation**: Calculates theoretical performance based on hardware specs.

### 5. Automatic Hardware Selection

- **Dynamic Strategy Selection**: Automatically chooses between GPU, parallel CPU, or single-threaded CPU based on problem size and available hardware.

## Implementation Details

### GPU Kernel Design

The GPU kernels are designed to maximize register utilization by:

1. Processing multiple rays per thread block
2. Keeping all ray state data in registers
3. Minimizing global memory access
4. Using vectorized operations where possible

### CPU Parallelization Strategy

The CPU parallelization strategy:

1. Divides rays into chunks based on CPU core count
2. Processes each chunk in a separate process
3. Combines results after processing
4. Avoids unnecessary data copying between processes

### Memory Management

Memory management is optimized by:

1. Processing rays in batches rather than all at once
2. Using NumPy arrays for efficient data transfer
3. Reusing arrays where possible to minimize allocations
4. Cleaning up intermediate results to free memory

## Performance Expectations

Based on the implementation and hardware capabilities:

- **GPU Acceleration**: Expect 10-100x speedup over single-threaded CPU for large simulations (1000+ wavelengths)
- **Multi-Core CPU**: Expect near-linear scaling with CPU core count
- **Memory Usage**: Can handle 10,000+ wavelengths on systems with 8GB+ RAM

## Usage Examples

### Basic Simulation

```bash
python gpu_accelerated_simulation.py --wavelengths 100
```

### Performance Profiling

```bash
python profile_performance.py --wavelengths 100 --max-wavelengths 1000
```

### Testing

```bash

```

## Future Improvements

1. **Advanced GPU Kernels**: Implement more sophisticated GA operations in CUDA
2. **Mixed Precision**: Add support for half-precision (FP16) for higher performance
3. **Multi-GPU Support**: Distribute workload across multiple GPUs
4. **Visualization**: Add real-time visualization of simulation results
5. **Integration**: Tighter integration with the core Kingdon library
